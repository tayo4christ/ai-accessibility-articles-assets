# AI Accessibility Articles Assets

This repository stores images and diagrams used in my technical writing projects, including articles published on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/) and [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/).

The images here illustrate concepts related to **AI for accessibility**, including:
- Translating Makaton gestures into English
- The AURA prototype (Adaptive Speech Assistant)
- Single vs Multimodal AI systems
- Applications of multimodal AI (education, healthcare, workplace)
